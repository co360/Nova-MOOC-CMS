The name of NOVA is from my study-group when I am pursing master degree in USC.
It is also the name of the 'wild women' name in the movie <Planet of the Apes>.
Honestly, I hate ignorance but platform such as coursera and udemy provide people a good environment.

This is the largest project I have ever attend and lead.
To write build a comprehensive MOOC website like Coursera and Udemy
